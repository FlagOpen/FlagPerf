@dataclasses.dataclass
class DataConfig(base_config.Config):
    """The base configuration for building datasets.

  Attributes:
    input_path: The path to the input. It can be either (1) a str indicating a
      file path/pattern, or (2) a str indicating multiple file paths/patterns
      separated by comma (e.g "a, b, c" or no spaces "a,b,c"), or (3) a list of
      str, each of which is a file path/pattern or multiple file paths/patterns
      separated by comma, or (4) a dictionary of the previous three approaches
      for more advanced data mixing using named access. It should not be
      specified when the following `tfds_name` is specified.
    tfds_name: The name of the tensorflow dataset (TFDS). It should not be
      specified when the above `input_path` is specified.
    tfds_split: A str indicating which split of the data to load from TFDS. It
      is required when above `tfds_name` is specified.
    global_batch_size: The global batch size across all replicas.
    is_training: Whether this data is used for training or not. This flag is
      useful for consumers of this object to determine whether the data should
      be repeated or shuffled.
    drop_remainder: Whether the last batch should be dropped in the case it has
      fewer than `global_batch_size` elements.
    shuffle_buffer_size: The buffer size used for shuffling training data.
    cache: Whether to cache dataset examples. If `True`, we will cache the
      dataset after applying the decode_fn and parse_fn. It can be used to avoid
      re-reading from disk, re-decoding and re-parsing the example on the second
      epoch, but it requires significant memory overhead.
    cycle_length: The number of files that will be processed concurrently when
      interleaving files.
    block_length: The number of consecutive elements to produce from each input
      element before cycling to another input element when interleaving files.
    deterministic: A boolean controlling whether determinism should be enforced.
    sharding: Whether sharding is used in the input pipeline.
    enable_tf_data_service: A boolean indicating whether to enable tf.data
      service for the input pipeline.
    tf_data_service_address: The URI of a tf.data service to offload
      preprocessing onto during training. The URI should be in the format
      "protocol://address", e.g. "grpc://tf-data-service:5050". It can be
      overridden by `FLAGS.tf_data_service` flag in the binary.
    tf_data_service_job_name: The name of the tf.data service job. This argument
      makes it possible for multiple datasets to share the same job. The default
      behavior is that the dataset creates anonymous, exclusively owned jobs.
    tfds_data_dir: A str specifying the directory to read/write TFDS data.
    tfds_as_supervised: A bool. When loading dataset from TFDS, if True, the
      returned tf.data.Dataset will have a 2-tuple structure (input, label)
      according to builder.info.supervised_keys; if False, the default, the
      returned tf.data.Dataset will have a dictionary with all the features.
    tfds_skip_decoding_feature: A str to indicate which features are skipped for
      decoding when loading dataset from TFDS. Use comma to separate multiple
      features. The main use case is to skip the image/video decoding for better
      performance.
    enable_shared_tf_data_service_between_parallel_trainers: A bool. When set to
      true, only a single tf.data service will be started, and it will be shared
      between all the trainer run simultaneously, e.g. using vizier to tune
      hyperparameters. This will save CPU and RAM resources compared to running
      separate tf.data service for each trainer. Notice that if batch size is
      different for different trainers, the field
      apply_tf_data_service_before_batching also needs to be true so that only a
      single tf.data service instance will be created. In this case, tf.data
      service will be applied before batching operation. So make sure to not
      apply any processing steps after batching (e.g. in postprocess_fn) since
      they wouldn't be paralleled by tf.data service and may slow down your
      tf.data pipeline. When using shared tf.data service, the tf.data dataset
      must be infinite, and slow trainer may skip certain training examples.
      More details about shared tf.data service can be found at:
      https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service#sharing_tfdata_service_with_concurrent_trainers.
    apply_tf_data_service_before_batching: A bool. If set to True, tf.data
      service will be applied before batching operation. This is useful to make
      sure only a single tf.data service instance is created when
      enable_shared_tf_data_service_between_parallel_trainers is true and batch
      size is changing between parallel trainers.
    trainer_id: A string. The id of the trainer if there are multiple parallel
      trainer running at the same time, e.g. in vizier tuning case. It will be
      automatically set if this field is needed. Users does not need to set it
      when creating experiment configs.
    seed: An optional seed to use for deterministic shuffling/preprocessing.
    prefetch_buffer_size: An int specifying the buffer size of prefetch
      datasets. If None, the buffer size is autotuned. Specifying this is useful
      in case autotuning uses up too much memory by making the buffer size too
      high.
