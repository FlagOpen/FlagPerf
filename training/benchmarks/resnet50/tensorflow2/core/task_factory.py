  This decorator supports registration of tasks as follows:

  ```
  @dataclasses.dataclass
  class MyTaskConfig(TaskConfig):
    # Add fields here.
    pass

  @register_task_cls(MyTaskConfig)
  class MyTask(Task):

    pass

  my_task_config = MyTaskConfig()
  my_task = get_task(my_task_config)  # Returns MyTask(my_task_config).
  ```

  Besisdes a class itself, other callables that create a Task from a TaskConfig
  can be decorated by the result of this function, as long as there is at most
  one registration for each config class.

  Args:
    task_config_cls: a subclass of TaskConfig (*not* an instance of TaskConfig).
      Each task_config_cls can only be used for a single registration.

  Returns:
    A callable for use as class decorator that registers the decorated class
    for creation from an instance of task_config_cls.
