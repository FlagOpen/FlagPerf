# GPT-NeoX Auxiliary Tools

This directory contains a number of auxiliary tools that are useful for working with GPT-NeoX but not part of the main training code.

## Bash

This directory contains some simple, frequently used bash commands to make working on multiple machines easier.

## Checkpoints

This directory contains tools for manipulating and converting checkpoints including changing the parallelism settings of a pretrained model, converting between GPT-NeoX and the transformers library, and updating checkpoints trained with Version 1.x of this library to be compatible with Version 2.x.

## Datasets

This directory contains tools for downloading and preprocessing datasets to the format expected by the GPT-NeoX library.
