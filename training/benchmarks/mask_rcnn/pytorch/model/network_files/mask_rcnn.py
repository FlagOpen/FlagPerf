class MaskRCNN(FasterRCNN):
    """
        Implements Mask R-CNN.

        The input to the model is expected to be a list of tensors, each of shape [C, H, W], one for each
        image, and should be in 0-1 range. Different images can have different sizes.

        The behavior of the model changes depending if it is in training or evaluation mode.

        During training, the model expects both the input tensors, as well as a targets (list of dictionary),
        containing:
            - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the ground-truth boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
              ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
            - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the class label for each ground-truth box
            - masks (UInt8Tensor[N, H, W]): the segmentation binary masks for each instance

        The model returns a Dict[Tensor] during training, containing the classification and regression
        losses for both the RPN and the R-CNN, and the mask loss.

        During inference, the model requires only the input tensors, and returns the post-processed
        predictions as a List[Dict[Tensor]], one for each input image. The fields of the Dict are as
        follows:
            - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the predicted boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
              ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
            - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the predicted labels for each image
            - scores (Tensor[N]): the scores or each prediction
            - masks (UInt8Tensor[N, 1, H, W]): the predicted masks for each instance, in 0-1 range. In order to
              obtain the final segmentation masks, the soft masks can be thresholded, generally
              with a value of 0.5 (mask >= 0.5)

        Args:
            backbone (nn.Module): the network used to compute the features for the model.
                It should contain a out_channels attribute, which indicates the number of output
                channels that each feature map has (and it should be the same for all feature maps).
                The backbone should return a single Tensor or and OrderedDict[Tensor].
            num_classes (int): number of output classes of the model (including the background).
                If box_predictor is specified, num_classes should be None.

                They are generally the mean values of the dataset on which the backbone has been trained
                on
            image_std (Tuple[float, float, float]): std values used for input normalization.

                considered as negative during training of the RPN.
            rpn_batch_size_per_image (int): number of anchors that are sampled during training of the RPN
                for computing the loss
            rpn_positive_fraction (float): proportion of positive anchors in a mini-batch during training
                of the RPN
            rpn_score_thresh (float): during inference, only return proposals with a classification score
                greater than rpn_score_thresh
            box_roi_pool (MultiScaleRoIAlign): the module which crops and resizes the feature maps in

                greater than box_score_thresh
